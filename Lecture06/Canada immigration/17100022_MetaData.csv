1,"Period from July 1 to June 30."
2,"Interprovincial migration represents movements from one province or territory to another, involving a change in usual place of residence. A person who takes up residence in another province or territory is an out-migrant with reference to the province or territory of origin, and an in-migrant with reference to the province or territory of destination. Net interprovincial migration is the difference between the number of in-migrants and the number of out-migrants."
3,"From 1971/1972 to 1975/1976, estimates are based on Family Allowance data. From 1976/1977 to 2020/2021, estimates are based on Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) tax data. For 2021/2022, estimates are based on Canada child benefit data from CRA."
4,"From 1971/1972 to 1975/1976, estimates were based on Family Allowance data. From 1976/1977 to 1990/1991, estimates were based on Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) tax data. Data for Northwest Territories and Nunavut are presented separately from 1991/1992."
5,"From 1976/1977 to 1990/1991, in-migrants, out-migrants and net migration totals do not include migration between Northwest Territories and Nunavut."
6,"Prior to 1991/1992, only data for Northwest Territories and Nunavut combined are available. From 1991/1992 to 2020/2021, estimates were based on Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) tax data. For 2021/2022, estimates were based on Canada child benefit data from CRA."
7,"Data for Northwest Territories and Nunavut are presented separately from 1991/1992."
8,"The number of interprovincial migrants is final up to 2020/2021 and preliminary for 2021/2022."
9,"The population growth, which is used to calculate population estimates, is comprised of the natural growth (Table 17100008), international migration (Table 17100008) and interprovincial migration (Tables 17100008, 17100021 and 17100022)."
