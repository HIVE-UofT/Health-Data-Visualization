3,"Potential years of life lost (PYLL) is the number of years of potential life not lived when a person dies ""prematurely"", defined for this indicator as before age 75. All rates in this table are calculated using the population aged 0 to 74."
4,"Counts and rates in this table exclude: deaths of non-residents of Canada; deaths of residents of Canada whose province or territory of residence was unknown; deaths for which age of decedent was unknown."
5,"Rates in this table are based on place of residence for indicators derived from death events."
6,"For data year 2000 to 2009, missing data on sex of the deceased were imputed based on death registration number. Starting with 2010 data year, missing data on sex of the deceased were imputed based on the cause of death information and a logistic regression."
7,"External causes of unintentional injuries include deaths due to accidental causes such as motor vehicle accidents, falls, poisoning, drowning, fires, natural, environmental and mechanical factors, but not medical misadventures, abnormal reactions or complications."
8,"Potential years of life lost (PYLL) for the Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut should be interpreted with caution due to a small underlying count."
9,"The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period and (...) for figures not applicable."
10,"The CANSIM table 102-0110 is an update of CANSIM table 102-0010."
11,"For data year 2005 to 2009, the population estimates used to calculate the mortality rate are presented in the Appendix II of the publication ""Mortality Summary List of Causes"" (catalogue number 84F0209XIE)."
12,"Starting with the 2010 data year, information regarding the population estimates used for the mortality rate calculations is found in the ""Data sources"" entry for survey number 3233."
13,"The totals (all causes of death) by age group and/ or sex presented in this table may not reflect those given in CANSIM tables 102-0501 to 102-0510, 102-0030 due to the correction of age or sex information that was inconsistent with the underlying cause of death."
