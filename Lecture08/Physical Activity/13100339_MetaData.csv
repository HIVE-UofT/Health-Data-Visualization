6,"Accelerometry data for 3-5 year old children was collected in 60 second epochs (defined movement intervals) for the 2011 reference period and in 15 second epochs for all other reference periods. The data cannot be compared between reference periods as there are differences in the amount of physical activity time captured using the different epoch times. Thresholds for moderate to vigorous activity for the 2011 reference period were updated to be consistent with 2013 and 2015 (update made in 2016)."
7,"The sample size for 3 to 5 year olds produces reliable national estimates for both sexes combined only."
