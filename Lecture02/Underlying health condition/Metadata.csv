1,"Source: Statistics Canada, Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), 2017 and 2018"
2,"Underlying health conditions considered include the following: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity (self-reported body mass index greater than or equal to 30), high blood pressure, currently having cancer, heart disease, suffering from the effects of a stroke, diabetes, or dementia. The number of conditions reported by each respondent was summed, for a possible total of 8."
3,"This variable indicates the highest level of education attained among all members of the household."
4,"Refers to people living in households where the highest level of education is high school graduation or less."
5,"Refers to people living in households where the highest level of education is a community college/technical school/university certificate, some postsecondary education or a university graduate."
6,"This variable is a distribution of respondents in tertiles (three categories including approximately the same percentage of residents for each province) based on the adjusted ratio of respondents’ total household income to the low income cut-off corresponding to their household and community size. It provides, for each respondent, a relative measure of their household income to the household incomes of all other respondents. Tertiles are generated using weighted data and are calculated only for valid responses (""not stated"", ""refusal"" and ""don't know"" are excluded). The Territories are excluded from this derived variable."
7,"Refers to people who are, or have been, landed immigrants in Canada. A landed immigrant is a person who has been granted the right to live in Canada permanently by immigration authorities. Non-permanent residents are persons from another country who live in Canada and have a work or study permit, or are claiming refugee status, as well as family members living here with them. Canadian citizens by birth are not landed immigrants."
8,"The Employment Equity Act defines visible minorities as ""persons other than Aboriginal peoples who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour"". The non-visible-minority category refers to those who reported being ""white only""."
9,"Includes persons who reported being an Aboriginal person, that is, First Nations (North American Indian), Métis or Inuk (Inuit)."
10,"Persons who identified as Indigenous and provided a single response of ""First Nations""."
11,"Persons who identified as Indigenous and provided a single response of ""Métis""."
12,"Persons who identified as Indigenous and provided a single response of ""Inuk (Inuit)""."
13,"Persons who identified as Indigenous but who did not report being either First Nations, Métis or Inuit, or who provided multiple responses."
14,"Persons who did not identify as Indigenous."
15,"Persons who described their cultural or racial background as ""Black"" only."
16,"Persons who described their cultural or racial background as ""Chinese"", ""Filipino"", ""Southeast Asian (e.g., Vietnamese, Cambodian, Malaysian, Laotian)"", ""Korean"", or ""Japanese"" only."
17,"Persons who described their cultural or racial background as ""South Asian (e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan)"" only."
18,"Persons who described their cultural or racial background as ""Arab"" or ""West Asian (e.g., Iranian, Afghan)"" only."
19,"Persons who described their cultural or racial background as ""Latin American"" only."
20,"Persons who described their cultural or racial background under multiple categories."
21,"Percentages are rounded to the nearest tenth. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred."
22,"The confidence interval illustrates the degree of variability associated with a rate. Wide confidence intervals indicate high variability, thus, these rates should be interpreted with due caution. When comparing estimates, it is important to use confidence intervals to determine if differences between values are statistically significant."
23,"Bootstrapping techniques were used to produce the 95% confidence intervals (CIs)."
24,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) from 15.1% to 35.0% are identified as follows: (E) use with caution."
25,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 35.0% or that did not meet the minimum sample size requirement were suppressed due to extreme sampling variability and are identified as follows: (F) too unreliable to be published."
